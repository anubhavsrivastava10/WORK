# Flask

#### What is Flask?
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python.The “micro” in microframework means 
Flask aims to keep the core simple but extensible. Flask won’t make many decisions for 
you, such as what database to use. Those decisions that it does make, such as what 
templating engine to use, are easy to change.
The Flask project is honest about thread-locals, does not hide them, and calls out in the
code and documentation where they are used.

#### Creating a Hello world Program

from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
return 'Hello, World!'

_from flask import Flask_ 
Imported the flask Class

_app = Flask(__name__)_
Create an instance of this class.If you are using a single module use(__name__) becasue depending on if its started as an application or imported as a module with different name.(__xxxx__).This is needed so that Flask knows where to look for template,static file etc.

_@app.route('/')_
It is used to give the give the URL to a particular function so that the Flask knows which URL is going to trigger what function.

_def hello_world(): return 'Hello, World!'_
The function is given a name which is also used to generate URLs for that particular function, and returns the message we want to display in the user’s browser.
